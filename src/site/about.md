### Programming

My favorite programming language is [Uiua](https://www.uiua.org/), second favorite is [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/). I mostly write JavaScript.

### Music

I primarily listen to [IDM/braindance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_dance_music), [alt rock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_rock), and [ambient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambient_music). My favorite artists are [Autechre](https://www.last.fm/user/thekillective/library/music/Autechre), [Radiohead](https://www.last.fm/user/thekillective/library/music/Radiohead), and [Bon Iver](https://www.last.fm/user/thekillective/library/music/Bon+Iver).

### Games

Games are cool. Fun. I like chess but it fucks me over so I rarely play it. Blackjack is a lot of fun, so is Texas Hold'Em. If you're not actually losing money by playing it. I would not know, I've never been to a casino before. A few years ago I played poker with my buddies and got third out of fourth place. It was me and this kid my age versus two fourty-year-old men. They beat our asses but it was extremely fun. I haven't seen them since then. They might be dead.

Portal 2 is probably one of my favorite video games next to OneShot and Yume 2kki. If I had to rank them, Yume 2kki would be on the top. It's a good game. I like it.
